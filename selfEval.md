# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

I feel I need to improve on time management as I do over analyze the content and lead myself in circles. I generally seek support from my peers when I am able, as it cleans up my understanding. A tip would be to not try to over think everything.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?

A function works like follow the leader where the function is the leader. Or a function is like Simon says where the function is Simon and you have to listen to it.

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.

An argument is the actual data that is being used to display code for a function.

A parameter is a placeholder that is given a value that just acts as a place to start from.

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?

Probably more about numbers in a function. That would probably be the biggest area to discuss.
